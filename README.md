A summary of my project is given below.
Analyzed a robust 225-rows, 10-columns dataset using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn Libraries, uncovering valuable insights.

Identified Total Death Cases, Corona Cases, check missing values, top 5 countries which have more number of covid cases, plot bar graph for top 5 countries, continent wise cases, find relationship between Population and total cases.
Utilizes diverse 5+ visualizations like boxplot, countplot, scatterplot, and distplot for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.A summary of my project is given below.
